# White Box Testing

White Box Testing is a technique in which software’s internal structure, design, and coding are tested to verify input-output flow and improve design, usability, and security. In white box testing, code is visible to testers, so it is also called Clear box testing, Open box testing, Transparent box testing, Code-based testing, and Glass box testing.

Testing based on an analysis of the internal structure of the component or system.

The Value of White-box Testing
A fundamental strength that all white-box techniques share is that the entire software implementation is
taken into account during testing, which facilitates defect detection even when the software specification
is vague, outdated or incomplete. A corresponding weakness is that if the software does not implement
one or more requirements, white box testing may not detect the resulting defects of omission (Watson
1996).
White-box techniques can be used in static testing (e.g., during dry runs of code). They are well suited to
reviewing code that is not yet ready for execution (Hetzel 1988), as well as pseudocode and other high-
level or top-down logic which can be modeled with a control flow graph.
Performing only black-box testing does not provide a measure of actual code coverage. White-box
coverage measures provide an objective measurement of coverage and provide the necessary
information to allow additional tests to be generated to increase this coverage, and subsequently increase
confidence in the code.
